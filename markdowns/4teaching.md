I have taught a variety of courses related to my research in political science and Middle East studies. In 2017, I was awarded the distinction of "Best Postgraduate Teacher" from the Oxford University Student Union.

### Yale University, Department of Political Science
- Political Economy of the Middle East and North Africa (UG/G, Instructor, Spring 2020)

- I supervised two undergraduate senior theses (2019) and am currently co-supervising an MA thesis on the politics of land reform in South Africa. 

### University of Oxford, Department of Politics and International Relations
