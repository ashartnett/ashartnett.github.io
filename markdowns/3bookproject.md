#### __Regressive Redistribution: The Politics of Inequality in Post-Colonial Autocracies__

A growing literature on land reform under autocracy shows that authoritarian regimes often pursue redistributive land reforms under with the ostensibly progressive motives of disempowering landed elites and restructuring the rural order. Although these strategies have often been assumed to be inequality-reducing, Hartnett finds that land reforms in decolonizing autocracies rarely achieve this standard. This observation motivates the bookâ€™s central research question: Why do regimes implement regressive land redistribution, and how do these reforms affect inequality long-term?

The answer, I argue, lies in understanding how leaders in postcolonial states resolve residual intra-elite conflict inherited from the colonial period.  Colonial administrations were more likely to establish formal linkages between landed elites than indigenous autocracies, where the landed class often retained more autonomy from the regime. These formal ties altered the balance of power between the regime, the landed elite, and other social groups, conditioning the breadth of colonial and early post-colonial ruling coalitions. In cases where the ruling coalition was comparatively narrow, regimes were more likely to expropriate landowners to satisfy the political, ideological, and developmental imperatives of decolonization and the demands of rising state elites. In cases where the ruling coalition was relatively broad, however, regimes enjoyed greater autonomy from social forces and were able to employ land reform strategically and regressively, often to the benefit of incumbent large landowners and other political elites.

Drawing on cross-national evidence and case studies of Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt, the empirical analysis traces the effects of these reforms on economic and political inequality. The findings substantiate the regressive nature of post-colonial land reforms, documenting how redistribution often benefits incumbent landowners or regime elites at the expense of the rural poor and middle class. Hartnett also argues that state-building after redistribution is a necessary component of mitigating the most severe regressive effects of land reform on political and economic order.
