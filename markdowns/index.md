​I am a Research Fellow at the Middle East Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School. DPhil (PhD) candidate in politics at the University of Oxfordwith a specialization in comparative politics and a focus on the Middle East in June 2017. During AY2017-2018, I will be a postdoctoral research fellow with the Middle East Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School of Government's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. I will join Yale's political science faculty as an assistant professor in July 2018.

My research interests include political behavior in authoritarian contexts; religion and politics; public opinion in the Muslim and Arab worlds; and survey and experimental methodologies. My work has been published  in Comparative Political Studies, Journal of Conflict Resolution, and Political Science Research and Methods.

My book manuscript, tentatively titled The Psychology of Repression: Identity and Polarization in Authoritarian Regimes,  develops and tests an original theory of state repression and its effects on processes of polarization in authoritarian contexts. The project employs a mixed methods approach, including lab experimental tests of the theory’s micro-foundational psychological mechanism and case studies of repression and polarization in Egypt and Tunisia based on in-depth fieldwork in both countries. 

I served as an AY2007-2008 Fulbright Fellow in Cairo, Egypt and have conducted fieldwork for a variety of projects in Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, Uganda, and the United Arab Emirates. I hold a B.A. in Arabic and an M.A. in Arab Studies, both from Georgetown University.
