â€‹I am a pre-doctoral research fellow at the [Middle East Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School of Government's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](https://www.belfercenter.org/project/middle-east-initiative), and am in the final year of my DPhil (PhD) in [politics at the University of Oxford](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/) with a specialization in comparative politics and a focus on the Middle East and North Africa.

My research interests include inequality and redistribution, authoritarian politics, historical legacies of colonialism, the political economy of state building and development, and quantitative methodology.

My dissertation examines the politics of land redistribution with a focus on how redistributive conflict engenders political instability. I develop and test a theoretical framework of colonial legacies and their effects on long-term state capacity and redistributive conflict.  I use field and archival research to gather qualitative and quantitative data from across MENA during the colonial and post-independence periods. I test my theory using an original large-N dataset of MENA land reform and case studies of redistributive conflict in Jordan and Iraq.

I hold an MPhil in Modern Middle Eastern studies (2013) from St. Antony's College, University of Oxford and a BA in Islamic studies and Middle East history from Boston University (2009). Both my MPhil and BA dissertations were awarded distinction by their respective departments. My research has been supported by the American Center for Oriental Research and the Centre for British Research in the Levant, among others. I have conducted archival and field work in Jordan, Morocco, Egypt, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
