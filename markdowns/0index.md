â€‹I am a pre-doctoral research fellow at the [Middle East Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School of Government's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](https://www.belfercenter.org/project/middle-east-initiative), and am in the final year of my DPhil (PhD) in [politics at the University of Oxford](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/). During the 2018-2019 academic year, I will hold a joint appointment at Yale University as a post-doctoral research fellow in the [Leitner Program on Political Economy](https://leitner.yale.edu/) and as a lecturer of [political science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/). My research in comparative politics focuses primarily on the Middle East and North Africa.

My research interests include authoritarian politics, historical legacies of colonialism, the political economy of state building and development, and quantitative methodology. My dissertation forms the basis of a book project which examines the relationship between colonial legacies, land redistribution, and political instability in the MENA region.

I hold an MPhil in Modern Middle Eastern studies (2013) from St. Antony's College, University of Oxford and a BA in Islamic studies and Middle East history from Boston University (2009). Both my MPhil and BA dissertations were awarded distinction by their respective departments. My research has been supported by the [American Center for Oriental Research](https://www.acorjordan.org/) and the [Centre for British Research in the Levant](http://cbrl.org.uk), among others. I have conducted archival and field work in Jordan, Morocco, Egypt, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
