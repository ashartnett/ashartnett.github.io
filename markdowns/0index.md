â€‹I am an assistant professor of [Political Science and International Relations](https://dornsife.usc.edu/poir/) and [Middle East Studies](https://dornsife.usc.edu/mdes/) at the University of Southern California. During the 2024--2025 academic year, I am spending my sabbatical as a Visiting Fellow in the London School of Economics and Political Science Department of Government.

My research interests are in the fields of comparative and historical political economy, with a focus on inequality and redistribution, colonial legacies, rural politics, and state formation in the Middle East and North Africa. My work has been published or is forthcoming in the _American Political Science Review_, _Nature: Human Behaviour_, and the _Review of Middle East Studies_. Prior to joining the faculty at USC, I was a post-doctoral fellow in the [Leitner Program on Political Economy](https://leitner.yale.edu/) at Yale University.

My book project examines redistributive conflict and inequality in colonial and post-colonial autocracies, specifically the politics surrounding land reform in MENA states. The analysis draws on extensive archival and field research in Jordan, Morocco, Egypt, the United States, and the United Kingdom. My research has been supported by the [American Center for Oriental Research](https://www.acorjordan.org/), the [Council of American Overseas Research Centers](https://www.caorc.org/), and the [Centre for British Research in the Levant](http://cbrl.org.uk), among others.

I received my DPhil (PhD) in [Politics](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/) from the University of Oxford in October 2019. During the 2017-2018 academic year, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at the [Middle East Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School of Government's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](https://www.belfercenter.org/project/middle-east-initiative). I hold an MPhil in Modern Middle Eastern Studies (2013) from St. Antony's College, Oxford and a BA in Islamic Studies and Middle East History from Boston University (2009).
