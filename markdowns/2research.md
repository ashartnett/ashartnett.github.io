### Dissertation and Book Project
Title: _Redistributive Authoritarianism: Land Reform and Regime Survival in the Middle East and North Africa_

My dissertation contributes a new understanding of redistribution under authoritarianism, and challenges prevailing theories about the positive relationship between redistribution and regime survival. I develop and test a theoretical framework for understanding regimesâ€™ incentives to redistribute land, highlighting the trade-offs associated with different land reform strategies. The dissertation presents qualitative and quantitative evidence to show that stable and unstable MENA regimes consistently diverge over patterns of land redistribution. The first half of the dissertation documents the colonial roots of redistributive conflict, and uses large-N quantitative analysis to show how colonial legacies in MENA constrained regimes' post-independence land redistribution strategies. Based on an original cross-country data set, my empirical findings suggest that radical, elite-targeted land redistribution occurs when the regime inherits an unpopular absentee landed elite from colonial rule on one hand, and a rising urban professional elite demanding reform on the other. In the second half of the dissertation, I process trace these mechanisms using detailed case studies of Jordan and Iraq, where I draw on subnational survey and observational data, as well as evidence from over 80 elite and stakeholder interviews, political biographies, government documents, and other primary-source Arabic material gathered during eighteen months of fieldwork in Jordan, the UK and the United States.
